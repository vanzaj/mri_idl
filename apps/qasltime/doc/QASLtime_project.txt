*Purpose* 

Traditionally, ASL has been used to measure only CBF values.  With multi-phase
ASL, it is theoretically possible to extract temporal parameters that could
provide information like bolus arrival time or time-to-peak as they are known
in DSC perfusion. ASL has the advantage over DSC for being completely
non-invasive.

The main purpose of the project is extraction of such time parameters from
ASL perfusion time curves and evaluation of potential diagnostic value.

Evidence: 
  Hendrikse J. Radiology. 246:572 (2008)
  MacIntosh BJ. JCBFM 28:1514 (2008) and MRM 63:641 (2010)
  Bokkers R. JCBFM 30:222 (2010)
  Qui M et al. MRM 63:374 (2010)

*Technical details*

Following parameters can be extracted: arterial transit time (ATT), time to
peak (TTP), and full width at half maximum (FWHM). ATT is the time it takes
magnetic bolus to reach a specific location in the brain, TTP is the time to
reach maximum perfusion signal at the same location, and FWHM is an indicator
of the duration of "active perfusion" (including T1 decay effects). Main focus
should be on ATT and TTP.

ASL data should be acquired at multiple phases. This can be done using either
R2.1.3 patch from Singapore that was used for ASL test-restest study or with
product version of ASL. The optimal number of phases is still unclear.
Simultaneous use of vascular crushers is not required, but may be helpful in
future.
    

*Current status*
(as of March 18, 2010)

Features implemented:
* QUASAR data load (PAR/REC)
* Cumulative averaging and subtraction 
  (separate for crushed/non-crushed/lowFA cycles)
* gammavar fitting to obtain time-to-peak from deltaMcr
  (needs improvement over selection of good/bad (noise-wise) time-courses)
* GUI app
